# _Project 4 - CUNNING LINGUIST_

## WRITE-UP

Today's project involved the construction of two separate, related, pages. One of which, the front page of the site, was rather simple, nothing too hard on it, and was centered around my skills as a guitar and spoken word specialist. The most interesting thing about it was the use of a new technique, :before and :after. Pseudo classes which allow for a large range of flexibility. It took more time and help to complete this page than I would have wished but it was a solid learning experience nonetheless. 

The second part, the purchase page, consisted of similar header and navigation bar designs as the first, but required a form as well, asking for credit card information and an email. The form was relatively simple and, for the most part, drew on knowledge I already possessed. However, it also incorporated a fancy font which needed setting up which I got from the superior, bro face Ian. After I was told how to do it, it was easy. 

I can see myself grasping everything I learned today with a few more days of practice. I need to allocate my time more considerately and minimize chances of burning out, overworking. I can get frustrated and, in turn, commit sloppy work. I will break regularly and try different things to see what works when it comes to staying focused yet clear-minded in the wake of continuous, grinding work. 

Good day.
